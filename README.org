This is an Emacs configuration you should definitely not try.

However, since you insist:

- *STEP 1*: Delete your existing Emacs configuration
- *STEP 2*: =git clone https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-hell ~/.emacs.d=
- *STEP 3*: PAIN

* Contributing

Yes, you can send a PR to add more pain and suffering to this configuration.  No, I will not fix your broken computer.

At some point in the future, I will subject myself to the community-conjured demons in this configuration live on stream.

* License

My team of lawyers have advised me that I must post a warranty disclaimer for the inevitable scenario when this configuration ruins your life:
